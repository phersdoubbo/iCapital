created a domain to showcase the final work in https://icapital.vazquezulloa.com/
with simple hello world add image 1.png to show case this under images/1.png

added database into my personal current DB to expedite process 
schema /backend/database/icapital-schema.sql
proof: /images/2.png

adding softlink to upload files faster given my current configuration
ln -s /Users/fernandovazquez/react/iCapital/backend/api/icapital-cors.php /Users/fernandovazquez/react/confluenceTools/api/icapital-cors.php
ln -s /Users/fernandovazquez/react/iCapital/backend/api/icapital-investors.php /Users/fernandovazquez/react/confluenceTools/api/icapital-investors.php
ln -s /Users/fernandovazquez/react/iCapital/backend/api/icapital-upload.php /Users/fernandovazquez/react/confluenceTools/api/icapital-upload.php
this will help us to have backend running in cloud and be seamless to updater server see proof in 3.png

decide to use php to allow in my hosting to have the application running without 
need to run localhost as well as mysql, will use my existing api director for faster deploymnent
under https://confluence.vazquezulloa.com/api in order to expedite the process and will use the same database 
i have setup as well for other projects to expedite the process but will include the script for creating the database
in the source code 

in 4.png we can see basic services running with entry added for testing.

File were uploaded successfuly see proof in images/5.png from a link like
