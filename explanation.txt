Given the opportunity to use AI, decide to get support from Curso to achieve the task opportunity
https://gist.github.com/pm-builder/979dcf6300d4dff1cdfd2ee4808af091

created a domain to showcase the final work in https://icapital.vazquezulloa.com/
with simple hello world add image 1.png to show case this under images/1.png

added database into my personal current DB to expedite process 
schema /backend/database/icapital-schema.sql
proof: /images/2.png

adding softlink to upload files faster given my current configuration
ln -s /Users/fernandovazquez/react/iCapital/backend/api/icapital-cors.php /Users/fernandovazquez/react/confluenceTools/api/icapital-cors.php
ln -s /Users/fernandovazquez/react/iCapital/backend/api/icapital-investors.php /Users/fernandovazquez/react/confluenceTools/api/icapital-investors.php
ln -s /Users/fernandovazquez/react/iCapital/backend/api/icapital-upload.php /Users/fernandovazquez/react/confluenceTools/api/icapital-upload.php
this will help us to have backend running in cloud and be seamless to updater server see proof in 3.png

decide to use php to allow in my hosting to have the application running without 
need to run localhost as well as mysql, will use my existing api director for faster deploymnent
under https://confluence.vazquezulloa.com/api in order to expedite the process and will use the same database 
i have setup as well for other projects to expedite the process but will include the script for creating the database
in the source code 

in 4.png we can see basic services running with entry added for testing.

What was done:
Create a website that allow to introduce all criteria from https://gist.github.com/pm-builder/979dcf6300d4dff1cdfd2ee4808af091 using following technologies
"react": "^18.2.0",
"axios": "^1.4.0"
PHP 7.4.3 for the server side 
MySQL and server filesystem

All point from the task were able to achieve and if I have more time i would add:
Databirt validation for legal age 
A more easy to use NJ dropdown
authentication and authorization to the api
authentication and authorization to the website
passekey integration for easy login
Properly storage of the file with access via signed url only to the user ( if needed to be seen , i did show to proof of working)
ADA validation adherence to WCAG 2.1 as showing error as soon as you leave the field
Validation on navigation via keyboard
Validation in different browser 
Validation in different OS
Validation on Mobile devices
UT for all the files
